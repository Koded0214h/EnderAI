| **P1.1** | **Finalize Tech Stack**       | **Languages:** JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, CSS. **Standard:** Use Manifest V3.                                                                                    | [ ]    |
| **P1.2** | **Project Folder Setup**      | Create the root folder for EnderAI with subfolders (e.g., `src/`, `assets/`, `lib/`).                                                                              | [ ]    |
| **P1.3** | **Create `manifest.json`**    | Define extension's name ("EnderAI"), version, icons, and **required permissions** (for content scripts, Chrome APIs, and web-based AI APIs).                       | [ ]    |
| **P1.4** | **API Access Plan**           | Define which part of the code (Background Service Worker or Content Script) interacts with each Chrome AI API (Prompt, Writer, Rewriter, Proofreader, Translator). | [ ]    |
| **P1.5** | **User Data Vault Structure** | Design the schema for securely storing user's data (personal info, experience snippets, narrative outlines) using `chrome.storage`.                                | [ ]    |
| **P1.6** | **UI Mockup**                 | Sketch the main UI for the extension's popup and the settings/vault page.                                                                                          | [ ]    |
